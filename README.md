# Insufficient Error Handling and Data Validation in PHP

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: insufficient error handling and data validation. The `processData` function processes an array of arrays but lacks robust handling of cases where input arrays lack necessary 'id' or 'value' keys. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.php` file shows the flawed function, and `bugSolution.php` provides an improved version.

## Bug Description
The `processData` function processes an array of arrays. It expects each inner array to have 'id' and 'value' keys. However, it only does a simple check, leading to potential issues.  Better error handling and data validation are crucial for production code to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.

## Solution
The improved version in `bugSolution.php` addresses the issue by implementing more comprehensive validation and error handling using exceptions.
